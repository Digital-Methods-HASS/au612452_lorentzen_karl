\section{31/10/2019}

\subsection{Action}

\begin{itemize}
\item Accidentally pressed "Enter" when using Regex, didn't know it automatically applied changes in the Regex box, important example of how a line break can also mess up the system.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Thoughts / Intentions}

\textbf {12:30pm}: Trying to do exercise for this week by converting stopword-list from Voyant to R, and vice versa. Can't remember the specifics, however.


\textbf{12:35pm}: Wrote another message to Adela asking for help on the conversion.


\textbf{12:45pm}: Took break from work on Voyant and R.

\subsection{Thoughts/Intentions}

\textbf{8:15am}: Class today, want to find out how to do the exercise.

\subsection{Action}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Typed (",) in Regex, copy-pasted the substitute text up into the text string, then typed (") to remove the quotation marks at the beginning of the words. Don't know how to make line breaks.
    \item Moving on to convert from Voyant to R. Inserted the stopword-list from Excel-document, typed \b and inserted " in the substitution box, copy-pasted it into the text string box, then typed \$ in the regex box and inserted a , in the substitution box.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}

\textbf{8:40am}: Did the exercise in converting stopword-list from Voyant to R and vice versa.

\subsection{Final Thoughts}

\textbf{11:55am}: Hope to get better at doing the next exercises.

\section{14/11/2019}

\subsection{Thoughts / Intentions}

\textbf{8:25am}: Class today on using Gitbash. Thinking about what to do with Danmarks Breve and which dataset to use.

\textbf{8:40am}: Adela suggests looking at different kinds of datasets to find out which one works best for us.

\subsection{Action}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Typed "ls" in Gitbash, shows various folders, hope they are all in order.
    \item Saved the data shell in my desktop, except it was in a cloud folder
    \item Moved the data shell to the regular Documents folder, easier to find in Gitbash now
    \item Created "thesis" folder in the Data shell folder using the mkdir command in
    \item Created text file inside the thesis folder using the "nano draft.txt" command in
    \item Deleted text file inside the thesis folder the "rm -i draft.txt" command
    \item Configured the username and email for Gitbash
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}

\textbf{09:53} Learned rudimentary principles of Gitbash.

\subsection{Final Thoughts}

\textbf{11:03am} Learned a lot today, have a better sense of direction in the course and what to do.

\section{20/11/2019}
\subsection{Thoughts/Intentions}
\textbf{12:38pm}:  Doing exercises in RStudio.

\subsection{Action}

Tidyverse installation 
\begin{itemize}
\item Typed install.packages("tidyverse"), which caused RStudio to install large amounts of data.
\item \textbf{ERROR} Typing library(tidyverse) causes error message, says there is no tidyverse package.
\item Trying to install tidyverse through the packages tab rather than code
\item \textbf{ERROR} Same problem as before, though perhaps it's because I press escape when I try to bring out the > symbol.
\item Seems to be working after waiting long enough for the installation to finish.
\item Not sure how to proceed with the exercise itself, though.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Final Thoughts}
\textbf{8:30pm} Hope to get help tomorrow with the exercise or at least understand the spirit of it.

\section{26/11/2019}
